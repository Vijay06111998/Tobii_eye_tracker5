### Driver Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Driver Monitoring System** that collects and analyzes real-time data on eye movements using a **Tobii Eye Tracker 5**. The system aims to enhance driver safety and ergonomics by detecting signs of fatigue, distraction, or improper attention during long vehicle journeys.

### Key Features
- Real-time eye movement tracking using the Tobii Eye Tracker 5.
- Data storage in CSV format for further analysis.
- Data visualization for eye tracking analysis.
- Focused on low power consumption for continuous operation during long vehicle journeys.
